# 4. Description  
A while back, Google encouraged developers to make use of their API. Many people built applications around the API, but alas, Google stopped issuing API keys for their API in 2006. This rendered that large parts of functionality for many tools fell away. SensePost Unified Data API (SPUD) will help get those tools working again. SPUD also integrates seamlessly with BiDiBLAH and Wikto. Best of all, SPUD is free.

# 5. Requirements  
.Net Framework
